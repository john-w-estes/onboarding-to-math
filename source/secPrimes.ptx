      What are fundamental building blocks of the natural numbers?
      In other words,
      is there a set of numbers from which every other number can be derived?
      The principal way we provide an answer to these questions is with prime numbers.

    <title>What is a prime?</title>
    <p>
      We say an integer <m>p</m> is prime if (1) <m>p > 1</m> and (2) the only numbers that divide <m>p</m> are <m>1</m> and <m>p</m>.
    </p>

    <title>Building blocks of the Integers</title>
    <p>
      We already mentioned that all numbers are derived from prime numbers,
      but what does that mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive integer is a unique product of primes.
      You can imagine that every positive integer has a unique serial number generated by its prime factorization.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the prime factorization of 48.
        </p>
        <p>
          No problem, <m>48 = 2^4 \times 3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the prime factorization of the following.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>84</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>1102</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

    <title>Divisors</title>
    <p>
      If the number <m>d</m> appears in the prime factorization of <m>n</m>,
      then we say that <m>d</m> divides <m>n</m>
      (or that <m>d</m> is a divisor of <m>n</m>.)
      So 8 is a divisor of 48 since <m>8 = 2^3</m> is a part of the prime factorization of 48.
    </p>
    <p>
      We define <m>d(n)</m> to be the number of divisors of integer <m>n</m>.

    <title>A formula for <m>d(n)</m></title>
    <p>
      A big part of mathematics is discovering patterns.
      <xref ref="dn">Exercise</xref> is a good place to start to find a formula for <m>d(n)</m>.
      Where do we start though?
      Primes.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>p</m> be a prime number.
          Find <m>d(p)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What about <m>d(p^2)</m>?
          Start with an example if needed.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What about <m>d(p^{\alpha})</m> for <m>\alpha \geq 1</m>?
          Start with an example if needed.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> be prime numbers.
          Find <m>d(pq)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Maybe we're getting closer.
      Ask yourself why we've picked these examples.
      We started with a prime, <m>p</m>.
      Then we looked at <m>p</m> at some power.
      After that, we looked at two primes being multiplied together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that any positive integer is a unique product of primes.
      So if
      <me>
        n = p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha2}\ldots p_k^{\alpha_k}
      </me>,
      and we know how to figure out <m>d(p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha2}\ldots p_k^{\alpha_k})</m>,
      then we have figured out <m>d(n)</m> for any positive integer!
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>n = p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha2}\ldots p_k^{\alpha_k}</m>.
          Find a formula for <m>d(n)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
