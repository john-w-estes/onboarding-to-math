      In addition to core classes such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, and Differential Equations, Belhaven's MCS department delivers a number curriculum add-ons.
      Let's take a look at what additional academic experiences we offer.

    <p>
      What does the Bible say about mathematics?
      What does life as a Christian mathematician entail?
      What role does change and randomness play in God's creation?
      These are deep questions that we will ask ourselves during throughout our mathematics coursework at Belhaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book <em>Mathematics through the Eyes of Faith</em>
      by Russell Howell and James Bradley approaches these questions in an intellectually honest manner \cite{eyesoffaith}. Students will use this text as a reference to write their own thoughts in their
      <em>Eyes of Faith Portfolio</em>,
      a collaboration of Eyes of Faith papers written over several courses covering chapter of our reference text.

    <title>Major's Field Test</title>
    <p>
      Every Belhaven math major takes the standardized Major's Field Test their senior year.
      The exam is conducted nationally and covers everything from Calculus to Linear Algebra to Algebra and Number Theory.
      In order to prepare for the MFT Exam,
      students take MFT Quizzes in key classes and review these quizzes in MAT 492.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Mathematical Research</title>
    <p>
      In MAT 391, 392, 491 and 492,
      students participate in the mathematical research process reviewing recent results of a select topic and attempting to further it.
      These students will present their findings as a poster and presentation at the Belhaven University Undergraduate Research Symposium (BUURS).
