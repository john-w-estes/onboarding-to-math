      The Fibonacci Sequence is probably the most famous of recursively defined sequences.
      A recursively defined sequence is a sequence in which the next term in the sequence is given by a formula of previous term in the sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fibonacci Numbers are defined as follows:
      <me>
        F_1 = 1, \; F_2 = 1 \; \text{ and }  F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} {for } n\geq 3
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then the Fibonacci Sequence can be listed as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, <m>\ldots</m>.

    <title>Number Formulas with Fibonacci Numbers</title>
    <p>
      There are a lot of interesting Fibonacci number formulas we can prove with basic proof techniques.
      We won't worry about proofs here
      (leave that for Discrete Math and Proof Exposition),
      but we will look at a few interesting examples.

    <theorem xml:id="fib1">
      <statement>
        <p>

    <title>The Golden Rectangle</title>
    <p>
      As we'll see,
      the Fibonacci Sequence appears in many surprising places.
      Two of its direct applications are the Golden Rectangle and Golden Spiral.
      Let's take a look.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use, as a reference, the article
          <q>Patterns in Natures: Where to Spot Spirals</q>
          to construct the Golden Rectangle and the Golden Spiral \cite{fibonacci}.
