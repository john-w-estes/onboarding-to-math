      Consider the map of the United States in <xref ref="map">figure</xref>.
      You are challenged to color the map with the rule that bordering states cannot have the same color.
      Overall this is pretty easy, BUT we also want to use the fewest colors possible.
      How many colors do you need to do this?
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Color the map in the fewest colors possible,
          where neighboring states do not share a color.
        </p>
      </statement>

    </figure>
    <p>
      This is actually a graph theory question.
      In graph theory,
      mathematicians are often curious about the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices so that neighboring vertices do not share the same color.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Draw a graph where the vertices can be colored in 2 colors.

        <p>
          Draw a graph in which 3 colors are needed to color the graph.

          How about a graph that requires 5 colors?
