      What do you want to print?
      Do you have to design everything?
      Thankfully, no.
      Becoming a skilled designer takes time and experience,
      and many of us want to start 3D printing well before we can design our own things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, there are some great resources where designers can share their designs and where we can download them to print ourselves.

      The quickest way to find good STL files is with Thingiverse,
      a social media platform for 3D printing enthusiasts to share their designs.

          Find a thing from Thingiverse that you would like to print.
          This object must have only one STL file.
          Send a link to this thing to your instructor for approval.
          This will be your first print.
