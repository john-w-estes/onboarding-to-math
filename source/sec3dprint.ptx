      Becoming a skilled printer take time, patience, and a lot of mistakes!
      In this section,
      we will not endeavor to take a deep dive into all aspects of 3D printing,
      but instead we will give a quick overview of this fun,
      applicable, and quickly-growing field of technology.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>FDM Printers</title>
    <p>
      Fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers work by taking thermoplastic material at a high temperature and extruding it through a nozzle onto a bed layer by layer.
      Over time, these layers stack to form a solid, 3-dimensional object.
      FDM printing is the most common and accessible way to 3D-print.
    </p>
    <p>
      FDM materials vary in strength and flexibility.
      At Belhaven, we typically print in PLA filament,
      a cheap and dependable material.
      Other filaments include ABS
      (for pieces needed higher temperature tolerance),
      TPU (super-flexible, rubbery material), nylon,
      and filaments with additives such as wood,
      bronze, carbon fiber, and glow-in-the-dark particles.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        An easy to way to think of FDM printing is like the reverse of erosion.
        Instead particles slowly being pulled away, they are slowly added.

    <p>
      You will learn to use a FDM printer in this course.

    <title>SLA Printers</title>
    <p>
      Stereolithography (SLA) printers actually proceeded FDM printing,
      being invented in the 1980's \cite{formlabs}, but has not be as publicly accessible until recent years.
      SLA printers use lasers to cure resin into a hardened plastic.

    <title>The Software of Printing</title>
    <p>
      One of the exciting capabilities of 3D printing is that it takes something digital and manifests it physically.
      This process involves
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            finding a digital object in the form of an STL file,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            placing this object along with print settings on a canvas in slicing software,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            slicing a printable file (Slicing is the process of writing a program for the printer to print a specific object.),
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            transferring the file to the printer.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      This may sound like a complicated process,
      but these steps happen pretty quickly in practice.
      We will learn each step in this chapter.

    <title>Printers at Belhaven University</title>
    <p>
      The Belhaven Maker Campus features several printing labs with both FDM and SLA printers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Fitzhugh Hall,
      you can find a variety of printing options ranging from the tiny Monoprice Mini (120 mm <times/> 120mm <times/> 120mm) to the enormous Formbot Raptor 2 (400mm <times/> 400mm <times/> 700mm).
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, you can find
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prusa i3 MK3S
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prusa i3 MK3S with MMU2 (prints up to 5 colors)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prusa Mini
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            MakerGear M3 IE (two extruders running independently)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Artillery Sidewinder X1
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prusa SL1S (SLA printer)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Belhaven's Art and Design Department houses another 3D printing lab that includes
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Flashforge Finder
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Lulzbot Workhorse with Pallette 2 (multiple colors)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Peopoly Phenom (SLA printer)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In total, members the Maker Campus have plenty of opportunities to print from early entry printing all the way to advanced printing projects.
