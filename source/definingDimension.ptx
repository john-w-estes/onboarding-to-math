      We have already looked at fractals and found some interesting things about them.
      One of the more interesting fact is that fractals have non-integer dimensions!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fractals make us wonder what exactly is dimension.

    <title>Dimension in Linear Algebra</title>
    <p>
      Linear Algebra is also very concerned with the notion of dimension.
      In linear algebra, we visit unfamiliar worlds,
      and we often wonder how big they are.
      These
      <q>worlds</q>
      are called vector spaces,
      and the size of these worlds is how we define dimension.
    </p>
    <p>
      We typically express the characters in these worlds as matrices.
      In particular,
      a <m>m \times n</m>-matrix is considered to be a <m>mn</m>-dimensional object m
      (where <m>m</m> is the number of rows and <m>n</m> is the number of columns).
    </p>
