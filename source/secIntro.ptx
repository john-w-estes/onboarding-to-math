      The Mathematics and Computer Science Department (MCS) at Belhaven University rely on three crucial pillars:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Community
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Academic Experiences
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Technology
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will take time this semester to look at all of these this semester,
      and we encourage all of our students to take it to heart.
      In fact, we want all of our students to memorize the Mathematics and Computer Science Mission Statement.

      I pursue my career and calling through community,
      academic experiences, and technology.

      Most courses in the MCS utilize Microsoft Teams,
      a professional, team-building messaging app.
      The quickest and easiest way to support the Community pillar of the MCS Mission Statement is to simply download Teams,
      join our course's team
      (listed in the syllabus),
      join the BelhavenSTEM team, and turn on notifications in both!
