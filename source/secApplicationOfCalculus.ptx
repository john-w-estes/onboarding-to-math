    You probably have heard of calculus, but it's common to not know what calculus is about.
    Calculus may be the best answer to the question
    <q>When will I ever need math?</q>
    In his book
    <q>Infinite Powers</q>, mathematician Steven Strogatz argues that calculus is the greatest human discovery \cite{infinite_powers}. How can that be?
    Why is calculus deemed to be so important?
  </p>
  <p>
    Calculus is the field of mathematics that harnesses the power of infinity.
    Through it, we can model movement, change,
    and a huge amount of other important applications in chemistry, biology,
    computer science, business, physics,
    engineering, and so much more.

        With a group,
        search online for places where calculus is used in application or has led to development in some field.
        Try to find six applications.
