      A fractal is a mathematical set in which each subpart is statistically similar to the whole.
      We typically introduce fractals as a structure obtained through the process of iteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will pull several interesting examples from Lippman's
      <q>Math in Society</q>
      \cite{math_in_society}. The first example illustrates the process of fractal generation of iteration.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="fractal_exmample1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that we start with a filled-in triangle.
          At each step of iteration,
          we connect the midpoint of each side and remove the middle triangle.
          We then repeat these steps.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The initial shape in a fractal is called the initiator,
          and the iterative action is known as the generator.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="fractal_exmample1">Example</xref>,
      the black triangle is the initiator,
      and the iterative step is action of connecting the midpoints of each side and removing the middle triangle.

    <title>Playing with Fractals (Group Work)</title>
    <p>
      Break into groups of three to complete the following exercises.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the given initiators and generators to create the following iterative fractals.
          Draw the iterative steps 1 through 3.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <title>Fraction Dimension</title>
    <p>
      We will discuss Dimension in more detail at a later time,
      but we all have some intuition of dimension.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          As a class, give an example of a 1-dimensional object.
          How about a 2-dimensional object?
          A 3-dimensional object?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Those are easy,
      but what about the fractal known as Sierpinski's Triangle shown below?
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_sierpinski">
      <caption>Sierpinski`s Triangle</caption>
      <image width="37%" source="images/sierpinski.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      It looks 2-dimensional, but is it?
      Consider the situation in <xref ref="fractal_exmample1">Example</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the Step 1 figure has 1/3 the area of the generator figure,
      and the Step 2 figure has 1/3 the area of the Step 1 figure.
      Notice that if we keep going through this process,
      we end up with Sierpinski's Triangle... and how much area does it have? 2?
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Fractals are interesting in that their measured dimension is not an integer!
        Fractal dimension is found by
        <me>
          D = \dfrac{\log(C)}{\log{S}}
        </me>,
        where it takes <m>C</m> copies of the original shape to scale it by a factor of <m>S</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The dimension of Sierpenski's Triangle is
          <me>
            D = \dfrac{\log{3}}{\log{2}} \approx \amp  1.58496
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      So Sierpenski's Triangle is not 1-dimensional!
      Or 2-dimensional!
      Its dimension is somewhere in between!
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In your groups,
          determine the dimensions of the previous three fractals.
