      Your friend (not as diligent as you) did not study for his American History test.
      It's multiple choice,
      so he knows he has a chance to get each answer correct by simply guessing.
      There are 25 questions with 4 answer choices each,
      how likely is it that your friend passes the test?
      There is .000043 chance that your friend scores a 60% or higher!
      His hope is misplaced!

      Probability is the mathematical tool used to calculate the likelihood of an event,
      and we find probability either through counting or measuring area.
      Probability questions handled by counting are called discrete probability questions.

    <title>Flipping Some Coins</title>
    <example xml:id="flipcoins">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example,
          what is probability of flipping two heads in two coin flips?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Solution:</em> First, we need to count the ways we can flip two coins.
          This set of all possibilities is called the <em>universal set</em>.
          <men>
            S = \{TT, TH, HT, HH\}
          </men>
        </p>
        <p>
          Next we find the ways our event is satisfied.
          This set is called the <em>event set</em>.
          <men>
            A = \{HH\}
          </men>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since out of the four possible options,
          only one satisfied what we want,
          we say that the probability we want is <m>P(A) = |A| / |S| = 1/4</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a subset of a universal set <m>U</m>.
          Then the probability of <m>A</m> is <m>P(A) = |A|/|S|</m>.
